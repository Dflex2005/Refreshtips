                                                National concord is also called collective noun concord. A plural or singulas verb  goes with a collective noun. <br>
                                                For example, <br>
                                                Our group meet (not meets) ones in a week.However, in some situations, a singular verb goes with a collective noun. Here is the principle; <br>
                                                If the collective noun performs an action, a plural verb follows, but if not, a singular verb follows.
                                                For example:
                                                Our group is celebrating its twentieth anniversary today.

                                                Parenthesis. <br>
                                                The parenthesis statement is an additional statement to what has already been said before. <br>
                                                Note A parenthetical statement should not be considered in choosing the verb that will follow. <br>
                                                For example, <br>
                                                The manager, not many of his workers, is (not are) here now. not many of his workers is just a parenthesis, therefore, the parenthesis should be ignored. <br>
                                                The manager is a singular noun, hence a singular verb.

                                                When "most" is used, the verb will either be singular or plural, depending on whether the referent is a countable or uncountable noun. <br>
                                                For example, <br>
                                                Most of the girls are tall.

                                                When "Much" is used in a statement, the verb to be used must be singular. <br>
                                                For example, <br>

                                                When "all" is used, it means either everything or all the people.
                                                When all means everything, the verb to be used should be Singular but when all means all the people, the verb to be used should be plural. <br>
                                                For example, <br>
                                                All are already seated in the church.
                                                 “All” means all the people are already seated in the church hence a plural verb. <br>
                                                But;
                                                All is well with me.

                                                 When all but is used, the following verb should be plural. <br>
                                                 For example, <br>
                                                

                                                All but samuel are (not is) in the house. That means, only samuel is absent.

                                                When either or neither joins two singular nouns together, the following verb should be Singular. <br>
                                                For example, <br>

                                                But, when either or neither joins two subjects (one singular and the other plural), the verb should be chosen by considering the nearer of the two subjects. <br>
                                                For example, <br>
                                                Either Bright or his friends know (not knows) me. <br><br>
